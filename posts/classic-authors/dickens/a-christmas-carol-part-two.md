It was a strange figure &#8211; like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man. The voice was soft and gentle. I am the ghost of Christmas Past.

Long past? &#8211; inquired Scrooge.

No. Your past.

Scrooge made so bold to inquire what business brought the ghost there.

 Your Welfare.

In this episode Scrooge is visited by two spirits. The first is the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who is RATHER SCARY. The Ghost of Christmas Past who follows is kinder and gentler.

As before, it is acted with great verve by Natasha and Robert Maloney. The adaptation is by Mike Betteridge of the Working Space Theatre Company, which performs in schools.
