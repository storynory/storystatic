This story is dedicated to Leonie with thanks for a great idea.

Marc Antony is a British Blue cat, with a bluey-gray coat, and little ears that point up above his owl-shaped face. He wears a lordly expression of serene satisfaction with himself and the world, and when he moves, which is not over-often, it is with dignity and grace.

Marc Antony’s owner is somebody that we know well. Her name is Isis, Katie’s best friend, who prides herself on doing things not just properly, but perfectly.

As you would expect, before she chose a cat, she spent long evenings on the internet scrutinizing every type of breed, and evaluating each one for looks, temperament, and health.

It was not long before Katie came round to meet Marc Antony, who liked her instantly. She scratched his chin while he purred with great gratification and turned his eyes into tightly closed slits of sheer contentment.

Isis asked, “Do you think you could make him talk?”

and Katie said:

“Well I don’t know, witch’s talking cats are quite special.”

“Oh go on, try, I would love to know what he thinks about…”

So Katie tried the cat-talk spell on him, but as she expected, the most he said was:

“PRRRRRRRRRRRR!”

Marc Antony was the sort of cat who liked to keep his opinions to himself - which is not at all like Katie’s own cat, Solomon, who can be quite mouthy.

As the months went by, Marc Antony matured into an even finer looking animal, as befitted a cat of his long pedigree.

Isis had intended him to be a house cat, and to remain indoors. The weather became warmer and he sat looking through the french doors with his large, yellow eyes spying on the birds in the garden. His day of freedom came when he jumped through an open window. He chose a sunny spot by the goldfish pond and there he sat, wide eyed and fascinated.

He was not quite a fully grown cat when disaster struck. Katie was one of the first to hear the news when she received an emotional phone call from Isis:

“They... they took Marc Antony.”

“What do you mean, they took him? Who took him?” asked Katie.

“The catnappers.”

“Are you sure, cats like to go roaming, you know. They usually come back when they get hungry, or bored with the menu at whoever’s house where they are being fed on the sly.”

“No, no, Marc Antony is a faithful cat. Besides, three expensive felines have gone missing on our street in one week. A police detective came round and told us that there’s a gang of catnappers operating in the neighborhood.”

“Oh, dear, that does sound bad. I hope Solomon’s okay.”

“Katie, I don’t think you have to worry about his account. Solomon is hardly worth anyone stealing. Oh, I don’t mean to be rude. He is very special. Unique. But nobody would pay a lot of money for him, unless they were a witch. He’s just an ordinary black cat without any pedigree at all. ”

“Yes, I suppose you’re right,” said Katie, who wasn’t offended. She could see the advantage in having a cat that catnappers didn’t want to steal.

“Listen Katie, do you think you can help us find Marc Antony?”

“How?”

“Well you know, with a magic spell or something.”

“Hmmm. If it was Solomon, I could trace him through the Crystal Ball. But Marc Antony isn’t a witch’s cat, or even a slightly magical cat. He’s just an expensive pedigree cat who won’t show up in any crystal.”

“Surely there’s something you can do?”

“Well I don’t know,” said Katie, “But I’ll have a think and maybe consult some books.”

Katie picked up a much loved volume called “Magical Cats through the Ages.” She turned the pages, but could find few clues from history about catnappers. Then she began to read about a witch’s cat that could shift its shape. Back in days of persecution, owning a black cat could get you burned at the stake- so witches made their black cats look like tabbies - and that got her thinking.

“Maybe Solomon could tempt the catnappers after all,” thought Katie.”

She found him curled up in the airing cupboard. He grumbled as she picked him up:

“Mewooh, where are you taking me? Don’t you know it’s rude to wake someone up all of a sudden?”

And he was not all pleased when he found himself placed inside the cat box.

“Nothing to worry about, Solomon,” Katie said, “We’re visiting my friend Isis. I know that you like her a lot.”

“Yes, I doooo,” agreed Solomon. “She’s a classy sort of girl, not like you.”

“Thank you, Solomon.” said Katie. “I always appreciate your snobby comments.”

Solomon was happy to jump into Isis’s arms as soon as he was released from the cat box.

“I heard that you bought a kitty-cat of your own,” he said, as she stroked his head. His eyes looked like they were closed, but really there were tiny gaps between his eyelids, and he was watching out for signs of another feline.

“Well darling, Solomon,” said Isis, “That’s why I need your help so very much. My own poor cat, Marc Antony, has been stolen by catnappers, and I was so very much hoping that you might help me find him.”

“Catnappers?” asked Solomon. “They sound like they could be rather dangerous.”

“But you’re such a brave and intelligent cat, Solomon, a few silly catnappers won’t bother you.”

“You’re so purrrrrrrceptive,” said Solomon, “But what’s in it for me?”

“I’ll love you forever,”

“And...” asked Solomon.

“And my dad will pay for you to spend an entire day at the luxury cat spar, where you’ll be pampered, and pedicured, and cat-massaged, and fed on catnip and wild organic trout to your heart’s content.”

“What about a life-time’s membership?”

“Oh come on, don’t push your luck, my Dad isn’t made of money.”

“Well ok-aaay,” said Solomon, “How can I be of service to you?’

“It’ll be so much fun, “ she declared, clapping her hands. “You’ll be an undercover cat. A kind of feline superhero. Katie will do a spell o to change your appearance - and then you will strut up and down our street every evening until the catnappers come along and catnap you. She will trace your location on the crystal ball, and we will rush into the robbers layer and rescue you and all the other cats who’ve been catnapped, including Marc Antony.”

“I don’t get it,” said Solomon, “Why do I have to change my appearance? Aren’t I tempting enough for a catnapper?”

Isis sighed. “Shall we tell him?” she asked Katie.

“No,” said Katie, “just let him focus on the reward for being brave.”

Katie performed a spell that she had prepared. It took no more than a few seconds. Afterward, Solomon admired himself in the mirror on the door of Isis’s cupboard. He now had a golden coat with dark spots, and a shiny, expensive, shimmer when he moved.

“Nice,” he said, “I’m a Bengal. I like it.”

When Katie went home, the new golden-coated Solomon stayed with Isis. When he went down to the kitchen, Isis’s mum and dad wanted to know where he had appeared from.

“He looks like a gangster,” said her dad.

Solomon was not impressed and slipped through the open window into the garden.

“Isn’t it dangerous for him to go out with catnappers around”? asked Isis’s mum.

Isis would never tell a lie, of course, but you can’t always explain to parents about magic, and so she invented a story that was the next best thing to the truth. She said that he was an undercover police cat who had an electronic tracer under his skin.

Solomon spent the evening patrolling up and down Isis’s street, admiring the large six-bedroom villas and the extensive gardens. “Katie’s mum could never afford a house on a street like this,” he said to himself mournfully. “She has far too many morals if you ask me, and absolutely refuses to dabble in alchemy. But what does she think all the bankers who live here do for a living? Hand out free cash to the poor? I don’t think so.”

It wasn’t until Saturday night that anything out of the ordinary happened. Solomon was starting to miss Katie. when he sensed that something was about to happen.

He could have just come invisible, or turned himself into a tiger, or done any number of things to escape, but he was ever so brave and just stood still. A large hand picked him up and dropped him into a basket. A lid came down and shut out the moonlight. It was pitch black inside. He didn’t like that.

In the morning, Isis was waiting for Katie by the school gate. She was very excited:

“Katie, I’ve got big news. There was no sign of Solomon this morning. I think he’s been catnapped!”

“Oh!” said Katie, “I’d been expecting it, for sure, but even so, it’s still shocking now it’s actually happened. Oh, I do hope he is safe.”

She worried about Solomon all day at school, and as soon as she reached home in the evening, she ran upstairs to consult the crystal ball. But to her dismay, there was no sign of Solomon.

“How strange!” she thought, “He must be deliberately hiding from the crystal magic, unless, of course… something dreadful has happened to him...”

There was no sign of Solomon the next day, or the day after, or even the day after that. Katie was increasingly concerned, and started to wonder if she might ever see him again. Then on Friday evening, she came back home, feeling ever so worried, and there he was, sitting on her doorstep with his usual black-cat appearance.

“Solomon! What happened to you?” Katie asked.

“Have I got a story to tell you,” he said. “ The catnapper’s place was a right old dive. I had to live in the kitchen with five other cats. But things were starting to look up. They were about to sell me to Romanian Billionaire who lives in an actual castle with 45 bedrooms and 26 bathrooms. I was to have my own boudoir and daily health treatment, and a top artist was going to paint my portrait. My flight was arranged - by private jet of course - when your silly spell ran out. One minute I was a prized Bengal Cat jetting off to a life of luxury, and the next I was me again. I’m as handsome as any pedigree, but they lost interest in me. In fact, they chucked me out! The cheek! What skin-deep superficiality! Looks aren’t everything you know!”

“I do know,” agreed Katie. “Some people are so shallow! All they think about is money and appearances. But you do realise that we love you regardless of your looks and lack of pedigree?”

“Well I suppose so,” admitted Solomon licking his paw. “The feeling’s mutual.”

“Well, thanks very much!” said Katie. “Oh! And what about Marc Antony? I do hope he’s safe!”

“MMM, he’s alright. They are sending him to a mega-wealthy family in Shanghai tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow!” There’s no time to lose!” exclaimed Katie. “Where is this catnapper hide-out?”

“ It’s not far actually. It’s at number 3 Plunder Road.”

“Really!” exclaimed Katie, because that address was just around the corner.

She phoned Isis and Isis told her dad that Marc Antony had been sighted, and he called the police detective who was investigating the catnappings. He insisted how urgent the situation was - and the very next evening the police called round at the address and rescued the cats - just in time to save Mark Antony who was packed up and ready to leave for Shanghai.

And so a number of beautiful cats were reunited with their rightful owners, and two catnappers were taken off to the station in handcuffs.

And perhaps, just perhaps, Solomon learned to appreciate that looks and luxury are nice, but genuine love is more important. All the same, he did enjoy his reward day being pampered at the cat spar.

  
And I’m delighted to dedicate this story to Leonie, who suggested that we write a Katie story about Catnappers - and Bertie took it from there. Leonie also says that she will come to one of my dance classes when she is in London - so thank you Leonie, I’ll be delighted to see you - because in case people don’t know, I teach dance and fitness when I’m not reading for Storynory!
